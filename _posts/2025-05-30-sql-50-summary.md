ðŸ“Œ **Progress**: 6 out of 50 problems completed

I've been working through LeetCode's SQL 50 set, and Iâ€™ve finished the first 6 questions. Most of them are straightforward, but theyâ€™ve already highlighted some important habits and patterns.

### Problems solved so far:
1. Recyclable and Low Fat Products  
2. Find Customer Referee  
3. Big Countries  
4. Article Views I  
5. Invalid Tweets  
6. Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

## Notes & Patterns

### 1. Simple conditions still trip you up  
Even on "Easy" problems, things like forgetting a `WHERE` clause or mixing up `AND`/`OR` can mess up the output. Being precise matters.

### 2. NULL logic is everywhere  
Problems like *Find Customer Referee* and *Invalid Tweets* remind me that `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` are more common than expected.

### 3. JOIN shows up early  
"Replace Employee ID..." was the first time a JOIN appeared, and it reminded me how easy it is to forget to disambiguate columns when table names get long.

### 4. Readability matters  
Some problems feel harder than they are just because the table names and field names are awkward. Renaming things with aliases helps a lot.

## Next steps

Iâ€™m planning to finish the next batch soon, and Iâ€™ll probably start grouping problems by topic (JOINs, Aggregations, Subqueries, etc.) as I go.

This is a small start, but writing out what Iâ€™m learning helps me remember it betterâ€”so Iâ€™ll keep posting short updates like this from time to time.
