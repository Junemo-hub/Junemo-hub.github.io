📌 **Project**: Boston Housing Price Prediction  
Compared 4 regression models and interpreted the results with SHAP & LIME.

### Models evaluated:
1. Linear Regression  
2. Ridge Regression  
3. Lasso Regression  
4. Random Forest Regressor

## Highlights

### 🔍 Random Forest performed best  
- Achieved **R² = 0.89**, significantly outperforming others  
- Captured non-linear relationships and variable interactions  

### 🧠 Explainability via SHAP & LIME  
- SHAP revealed global feature importance (e.g., RM, LSTAT)  
- LIME provided local explanations for individual predictions  

### 🛠️ Focused on learning  
This project was part of my study on regression modeling and model interpretability.  
I aimed to understand both the **predictive performance** and **explainability** of different models using real data.
