## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Junemo Moon

I'm a former ESG and credit analyst from Korea, currently transitioning into data science with a strong interest in finance, sustainability, and machine learning.

With a background in Mathematics and Economics from Sogang University, and over five years of industry experience, I decided to pursue a more technical and impactful path through data science.
